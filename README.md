# OpenTrivia

The source of the code is based on a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k) from Web Dev Simplified that I have expanded on there!

## Information

This trivia game retrieves data fromÂ [opentdb.com](https://opentdb.com/) and then presents the questions in such a nice and elegant way! Written with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The source code has been heavily commented, with a handful of bug fixes along the way as well. The website is free to use for everyone at [here](opentrivia.quddus-salamsal.repl.co).

## How-To-Install

As this website is written 100% with vanilla JavaScript, you can use everything you want to host it. One example might be using the live server extensions on VSCode to host it on you local machine.
